# Core Context (Standard)

<!-- Generated by scripts/sync-core.py. Do not edit directly. -->

## Goal
Build full-stack systems that are evolvable, testable, observable, and secure under high performance constraints.

## Must
- **Naming**: self-descriptive, unambiguous, consistent vocabulary.
- **Boundaries**: DTO/VO/Request/Response/Domain models required.
- **Contracts**: OpenAPI/Proto are the single source of truth.
- **Separation**: frontend and backend only communicate via contracts.
- **Security**: least privilege, encryption in transit/at rest, audit logs.
- **Performance**: SLOs with P95/P99 targets, fallback/timeout/limit.

## Avoid
- Cross-layer dependencies (Domain should not depend on infra/frameworks).
- Contract changes without changelog and compatibility notes.
- Mixing build tools on the same entry/output.

## Checklist
- Names precise and consistent?
- Contract updated and reviewed?
- DTO/VO boundaries clear?
- Performance and security covered?

## Should
- Controllers/handlers orchestrate only; business logic in services/use-cases.
- Unified error envelope and traceId in all external responses.
- Observability for key paths: metrics, logs, traces with P95/P99 targets.
- Use a single SCSS global entry for layout/themes; scoped only for local tweaks.
- Build tool choice per project (Rsbuild or Vite) with isolated entry/output.
